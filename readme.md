An example REST client made with React and Redux

## Features

- React + Redux
- REST queries

## Usage

### Building the project

[npm][npm] is used for building the project, which requires running a few commands. All of these should be executed from the project root.

First of all the dependencies should be installed:

```
$ npm install
```

Then there are two options. Building a development version:

```
$ npm run development
```

Or building a release:

```
$ npm run build
```

### Running tests

There is a script ready for running tests:

```
npm run test
```

## Deploying locally

Once the project has been built it can be deployed locally for testing:

```
$ npm run start
```

## Collaborate

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

### Issues management

Issues are managed at the GitHub [project issues tracker][issues], where any Github user may report bugs or ask for new features.

### Getting the code

If you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the [GitHub project page][scm], where the latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest release, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.
