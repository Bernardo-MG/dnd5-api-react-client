# React REST Client Example

An example REST client made with React and Redux, which queries the [Open Library][open-library].

## Features

- React + Redux
- REST queries

## Check it

There is an [online demo site][demo-site] which always reflects the latest version, taken from the master branch.

And a [development demo site][demo-site-development], taken from the development branch.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- [npm][npm]
- Node

### Building the project

First of all install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then there are two options for building the project.

You can create a development version:

```
npm run development
```

Or a production version:

```
npm run build
```

### Running tests

There is a script ready for running tests:

```
npm run test
```

## Deploying locally

Once the project has been built it can be deployed locally for testing:

```
npm run start
```

## Collaborate

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

### Issues management

Issues are managed at the GitHub [project issues tracker][issues], where any Github user may report bugs or ask for new features.

### Getting the code

If you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the [GitHub project page][scm], where the latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest release, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.
